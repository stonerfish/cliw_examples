# Cliw Examples.

This repository contains examples for [`cliw`] (command line in web).

 * The recommended way to use [`cliw`] for getting command line arguments is to not use cliw,
   but use a web-enabled clap [`we-clap`].  See the [`we-clap_demo`] for basic recommended use.

 * The [`we-clap_egui_demo`] shows a working example of how to use we-clap with egui.

 * Cliw can be used with regular [`clap`] but it is a little more work.  [`cliw_clap_demo`]

 * Cliw can be used without clap.  [`cliw_demo`]
